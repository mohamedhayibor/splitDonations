Split the Donations
====

I have noticed a common scheme for event organizers and venues.

> Split the donations (between the event organizer) and a venue (bar, coffee shop, coworking space...) (50 / 50)%

* Front end aka site
* contract code


Notes:
=====

Assumption: The person responsible of `donationAddress` will make sure of the conversion to fiat to be given to non-profits.

The contract is the owner of the funds until split between event organanizer and venue owner.

If you have an Eth meetup, put some skin in the game and set up your donations this way.

Working on the front-end but for now, you can interact with [mycrypto](https://mycrypto.com/contracts/interact)
